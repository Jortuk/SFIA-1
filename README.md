## Brief <a name="brief"></a>
Design a Create Read Update and Delete (CRUD) application utilising tools, methodologies, and technologies that illustrate all core modules covered during training so far.

The requirements are, however not limited too:
- Trello Board (or Kanban equivalent).
- A relational MySQL database created on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - displayed with an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- Clear documentation including architecture design, risk assessment, and so on.
- The CRUD application itself, coded in Python, that meets the User Stories on the Trello Board
- Testing the application for validation using Pytest - consistent reports and evidence must be provided to prove a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.
- A fully functioning front-end website with integrated APIs, using Flask.
- Code incorporated into a Version Control Machine (VCS), implementing the Feature-Branch model which will then be built through a Continuous Integration (CI) server i.e. Jenkins, before finally being deployed to a cloud-based Virtual Machine (VM).

### Project Proposal <a name="projectproposal"></a>
My project aims to function as an Inventory Management System (IMS) for footwear products, for a hypothetical website - 'Shoose.com'. As an admin, shoes can be added and linked to pre-existing shops within the MySQL database. Both are joined together on a joining table, showcasing two many-to-many relationships. The IMS will be automatically built using Jenkins and GitHub Webhooks.
